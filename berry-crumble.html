    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This berry crumble recipe may berry well be my favorite summer dessert, with the perfect balance of sweet to tart, tender to crisp, and fruit to crumble. I don't tack the word ultimate onto just any recipe. Some ice cream on the side is highly recommended.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup frozen unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make crumble: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Grate in frozen butter, stopping occasionally to toss butter into flour mixture until coated.</li>
        <li>Stir in egg yolks and vanilla with a fork until egg is mostly absorbed. Add 1 teaspoon vinegar; mix briefly. Use your hands to finish mixing, squeezing until clumps form, but mixture remains mostly dry. Add more vinegar if needed. Set crumble aside.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Combine blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries in another large bowl. Add sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper. Mix until well combined and sugar and cornstarch are mostly dissolved.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/2 of the crumble mixture into the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Press mixture down using a flat cup until well compacted. Spread berry filling on top. Sprinkle remaining crumble mixture over berries, squeezing some of the crumble into clumps.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is beautifully browned and berry filling bubbles, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
